This is a resource to aid in giving cyber security presentations, aimed at less technical audiences. The slide show itself only contains headings and key points, while the bulk of content should be presented verbally, and summarised in the included hand-out.

_I wrote this in 2018, while in the Army, and it was part of a security seminar I gave to the senior officers within our unit._
