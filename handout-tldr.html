                    The objectives of this guide are to give you a quick overview of what 
                    cyber security is, why it’s important, and the basic steps you can 
                    take to keep yourself, your connections and the organisations you 
                    work for safe from common threats.

                <h2>Intro</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                    <h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
                    In layman's terms, cyber security is simply the measures put in place to protect your 
                    digital life. There are two key aspects of a good cyber security approach:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>The technical side:</b> ensuring that your digital life is 
                            secure and not easy for a hacker to exploit
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The human side:</b> knowing how to spot, and how to deal with, 
                            a data breach or hack
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Why does Cyber Security matter so much?</h3>
                    It matters because of the sheer volume of data on you and your activity which 
                    is collected and stored digitally. All this data may seem trivial and 
                    uninteresting, but it holds a high value, and in the wrong hands a lot 
                    of damage can be done.
                    
                    <h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
                    Although individuals are targets, more often than not criminals have 
                    their sights set on bigger things; usually exploiting the company or 
                    organisations you work for or are associated with. The weak point in 
                    any organisation is nearly always the people.

                        A worryingly high proportion of individuals and organisations have been, or will be, hacked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The weak point in any computing system are the people - i.e. you. 
                        This often puts your contacts, the organisation you work and yourself for at risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A few very simple steps can make you significantly less vulnerable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sometimes there is a trade off between security and convenience. 
                        It’s beneficial to understand the risks in order to get the balance right.

                <blockquote>
                        It is important to understand the best practice when setting passwords since most of 
                        your online logins (email, social media, finance, work accounts etc.) can be easily 
                        compromised by a hacker if these steps aren’t followed. Consider using passphrases, 
                        which are made up of several words, or seemingly random characters.

                <ul>
                    <li>Use a different passphrase for each account</li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that each passphrase is strong (ideally 12+ characters, 
                        including numbers, symbols, upper and lowercase letters, but 
                        not dictionary words, names or places)

                        A password manager such as LastPass (or DashLine, OnePass, KeePass) will make 
                        applying these points significantly easier. It will securely store, and auto 
                        fill, each of your passwords, so that you don’t have to remember them all.

                        2 Factor authentication is a method of logging into your secure accounts on 
                        different computers/ devices in which you provide both something you know 
                        (a password), and something you have (a 6-digit number generated on your smartphone).

                            certainly have the option of setting up 2FA
